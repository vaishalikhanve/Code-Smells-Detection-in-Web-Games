# Code-Smells-Detection-in-Web-Games
Empirical Study on presence of existing code smells in web games. This repository contains all necessary source codes to clone data and  remove noise. This research study aims at investigating the existence of code smells in the games. To achieve this, we used JavaScript code smells detection tool JSNose against 361 JavaScript web games to nd occurrences
of JavaScript smells in games. Further, we conducted a manual study to find violations of known game programming patterns in 8 web games to verify the necessity of game-specific code smells detection tool. Our results shows that existing JavaScript code smells detection tool is not sufficient to detect game-specific code smells in web games.
